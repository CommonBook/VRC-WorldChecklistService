# VRC-WorldChecklistService
A rudimentary Python script to keep track of worlds you visit in VRChat.

- Has options for scraping un-visited worlds.
- Runs in the background while you play to automatically log the worlds you visit
- Exports to an Excel spreadsheet along with some data

There is no GUI.
Low code quality because I am not a good programmer and am also lazy.
