# VRC-WorldChecklistService
A rudimentary Python script to keep track of worlds you visit in VRChat.
Currenly WIP. Not in a usable state.

- Has options for scraping un-visited worlds.
- Runs in the background while you play to automatically log the worlds you visit
- Exports to an Excel spreadsheet along with some data

There is no GUI.
Low code quality because I am not a good programmer and am also lazy.

<h1>How to run</h1>
I aint compiling this thing so<b/>

As with any python script. Set up an environment through Anaconda, VSCode, or whatever tickles your fancy. <b/>
Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory. <b/>
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` <b/>
Then open main.py with python.<b/><b/>

Preferably using python 3.13 or above. Probably works with older versions but I ain't checking.
